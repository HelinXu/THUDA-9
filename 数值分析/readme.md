Helin's Notes:

- Though past exams can be found, there is NO GUARANTEE how well they cover your exam. In my case, there were at least 2 new problems.
- However, past exams still tell a lot about the key topics to appear in your exam. Make sure you really understand them. Discuss with TA about homework and examples from the lectures.
