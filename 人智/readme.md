# Foundation of Artificial Intelligence

Instructor: Rui Jiang

Grading:

- 3 credits.
- 50% (Homework * 10, program assignment * 5, course project * 2), 50% Final Exam (A4 cheat sheet allowed).

Helin's Notes:

- Thankfully, this year, the final exam was composed of ~7 problems, covering the main topics from lectures, similar to those covered in homework. I personally feel that with a fair understanding of topics from homework, you should be comfortable with the exam. However, this was not the case last year, when there were 2 instructors for this course.
