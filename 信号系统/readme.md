# Signals and System Analysis

Instructor: Qing (Joking) Zhuo

Grading:

Helin's Notes:

- Joking's classes are very interactive.
- After releasing the final score, you still have a chance to write & submit a final paper, which can save your grade after the final exam.
- Past exams can be found and are very informative.
- Past cheat sheets can be found, and can save you a lot of time.
- My cheat sheet is [here](./Helin_SS_cheatsheet.pdf). Use notability to [edit yourself](./Helin_SS_notability.note) if you wish.
