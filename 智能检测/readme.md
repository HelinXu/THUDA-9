# Smart Sensing and Measuring

Instructor: Li Cao, Lihui Peng

Course Description:

> This course meets the sensing and measurement requirements for data and information acquisition in automatic and intelligent unmanned systems. It gives the students basic knowledge of sensors and instrumentation technology, as well as professional knowledge of data analysis and processing in intelligent measurement systems. Focusing on the measurement methods of force, displacement, speed, acceleration, temperature, pressure, flow, and other physical parameters, the lecture introduces the working principles and signal conditioning methods of resistance, capacitance, inductance, photoelectric, piezoelectric, semiconductor, MEMS and other sensors; performance analysis of measurement system and evaluation of measurement uncertainty; theory and application of weak signal detection and multi-sensor fusion. Using the examples of scientific research, industrial intelligence, and automation, combined with the latest topics such as artificial intelligence and big data, the lecture will introduce new intelligent sensing and detection methods and strengthen the student's ability to solve problems comprehensively using the knowledge they have learned.
