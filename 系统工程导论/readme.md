Helin's Notes:

- Exam contents have not varied much for years. Though you can find a collection of past exam problems that are very informative, please DO NOT print them or write them down in your notebook and bring them to your exam, otherwise, this will be noticed during your exam.
- I have formatted all slides and released the printable pdf here. They have trustworthy coverage of the final exam. Only bring the printed slides and your actual course notes to your exam.
